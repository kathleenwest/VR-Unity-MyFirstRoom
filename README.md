This project presents my first Virtual Reality (VR) demo built in Unity exclusively for Android Google VR Cardboard devices as part of final assignment for an online course on VR development. The project, code, and designs are creatively my own, but follow the guidance, demos, and tutorials in an online course discussed in the background section of the project article. The project article has sections that discuss the VR app features, offer a full demo video, code repo, full list of assignment requirements, and detail my background with the project.
